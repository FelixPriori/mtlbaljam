Equally curious about the different influences and developments of this art form, the band's repertoire includes other music from the same sources, with a strong emphasis on rhythm, improvisation and dance such as beguine or mambo.<br></br>Michaël Srey carefully selects, arranges and transcribes each piece mainly from the big band repertoire. Thus, the band has created a unique, tailor-made repertoire with new pieces regularly added to the music stands.<br></br>The quality of its musicians as well as the composition of the group give it great versatility and allow it to traverse the history of swing and its various styles: second line of New Orleans, early jazz, swing era, blues, be bop, hard bop…<br></br>Dedicated to the precision and colors of the iconic arrangements of big bands, the horn section makes each of its notes shine and the rhythm section roars across the dance floor.",

Two times California Balboa Classic winners, they also proudly hold the title of 6-time Pure Balboa Classic champions!<br></br>Currently they run Balboa courses and mini-workshops in London, as well as travel to teach at dance weekends across Europe. <br></br>In class, they strive to share the knowledge they’ve gained throughout their dance journey and encourage their students to appreciate the joyful energy of Balboa, its subtle humour and the precious opportunity to be in the moment with the music and one another. <br></br>Lately, as Sasha has found a new obsession with tap dancing, percussion, and rhythm overall, they are becoming even more focused on different aspects of musicality, and aim to reflect that in their teaching.",
